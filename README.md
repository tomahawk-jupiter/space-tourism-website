# Space Tourism Website

This is a solution to the [Space tourism website challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/space-tourism-multipage-website-gRWj1URZ3). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

NOTE: On Frontend Mentor it says this project is part of a Scrimba course. I didn't follow this course, I made it myself.
